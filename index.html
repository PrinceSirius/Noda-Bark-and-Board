                                            I have been using noda bark and board for a few months now for my pups for both boarding and daycare and love it. Our
                                            first board booking had a pretty serious error occur and the owner addressed and corrected the issue quickly and
                                            professionally, mistakes can happen so it was nice to see they care and were happy to resolve the issue and didn't
                                            minimize my concerns. Since then I've boarded my dogs there several other times with no issue and lovely experiences. My
                                            pups are always happy and safe and it's nice to have somewhere I feel that way about for them. The prices are also
                                            really affordable. I love how they post pictures and I get to see my dogs and know they're making friends!
                                        </p>

                                            I used to feel guilty when I'd be gone from the house all day and would need to find a solution for letting my dog out.
                                            Now, I feel guilty when I don't have to work all day and she stays home because that is how much she loves this place!
                                            
                                            The staff here are VERY dog knowledgeable and pay special attention to each pup that walks through the doors. Dogs are
                                            put into groups based on their size and interaction levels and get tons of play time both indoors and outdoors. My dog
                                            is a rescue with "men issues" and they made an effort to have the female staff members handle her so she'd be
                                            comfortable and they keep a special eye on her for that reason.
                                            
                                            If you walk into Noda Bark and Board during a busy pick up/drop off hour, you will think you're watching air traffic
                                            control at its best. They are extremely efficient getting the dogs in/out, know each dog by name, and you can tell all
                                            of the dogs love it there!
                                            
                                            I feel very comfortable with this place and I'm sure my dog would love it if I could bring her every day!
